#Project Euler: Problem 1 â€” Multiples of 3 and 5
'''If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.'''

# def multiples3():
sumAll = 0 # set variable to zero to add the values to
for integer in range(1000): #use a for loop to iterate over all of the numbers 1000
    if integer%3 == 0 or integer%5 == 0: #for the numbers that have no remainder when divided by 3 or 5, add them to the sumAll variable
        sumAll = sumAll + integer #Continue to add them the variable sumAll
        # else:
        #     for integer in 1000:
        #         if integer%5 == 0:
        #             sumAll = sumAll + integer

#Even Fibonacci Numbers: Problem 2
'''By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.'''

count = 0
num1 = 0
num2 = 1
nth = num1+num2
# nth = num1 + num2
# num1 = num2
# num2 = nth
while nth <= 4000000: #while the nth term is less than 4,000,000 I will continue to go through all of fibonacci's numbers
    # num1 = 0
    # num2 = 1
    nth = num1 + num2 #make sure to redefine each number everytime it loops through
    num1 = num2
